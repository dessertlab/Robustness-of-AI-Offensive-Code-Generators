# Enhancing Robustness of AI Offensive Code Generators via Data Augmentation

This repository contains the results presented in the paper.

* The results of the experimental analysis, including robustness assessment and enhancement, conducted on 3 AI models, i.e., Seq2Seq, CodeBERT and CodeT5+ (``Experiments`` folder).
* The results of the performance evaluation on single-line vs. multi-line code snippets for each experiment (``performance_singleline_vs_multiline.xlsx``).
* The results of the survey we conducted with 31 domain experts to evaluate the semantic accuracy of perturbed description wrt. the original descriptions (``survey_results.xlsx``).
