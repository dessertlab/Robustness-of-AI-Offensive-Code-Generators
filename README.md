# Enhancing Robustness of AI Offensive Code Generators via Data Augmentation

The repository contains two folders, ``Results`` and ``Perturbation_tool``.

- The ``Results`` folder contains the XLSX files with results of our empirical analysis and a README.md file describing the files in the folder.

- The ``Perturbation_tool`` folder contains the source code, two script files to replicate the injection of perturbations in the intents, and the Extended_Shellcode_IA32 dataset we used in our experiments. The folder also contains a README.md file explaining how to set up the project, how to change the dataset, and how to run the code.
